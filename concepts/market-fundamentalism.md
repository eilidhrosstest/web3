# Market Fundamentalism
The belief that [market](../market.md) are inevitable and desirable feature of [capitalism](../capitalism.md) and that efficient and transparent [market making](../market-maker.md) enables capital formation and general public prosperity.

Often coincides with the belief that [market manipulation](../market-manipulation.md), [asymmetric information](../asymmetric-information.md), and [cartels](../cartel.md) in markets is undesirable because these phenomenon destroy trust in markets and inhibit [price formation](../price-formation.md).

The strong form of this ideology coincides with the so-called Friedman Doctrine that 
the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, possibly by any means.
